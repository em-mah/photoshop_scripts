2. em-mah_fit-rename
    > Uses the first layer in selection to rename and increment the rest of the layers.
3. em-mah_board-format
    > Takes 16 layers and reformats them in a neat 4x4 grid on a 1920x1080 board

## Installation

## Usage

These tools were created using Adobe ExtendScript for Photoshop.

## Notes
